        <p>Tell me something. When the rain falls on my face. How do you quickly replace it. With a golden summer smile? Tell me something. When I'm feelin' tired and afraid. How do you know just what to say. To make everything alright? I don't think that you even realize. The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe. You hold me like I'm the one who's precious. I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around. You can thank your stars all you want. But I'll always be the lucky one. Tell me something. When I'm 'bout to lose control. How do you patiently hold my hand. And gently calm me down? Tell me something. When you sing and when you laugh. Why do I always photograph. My heart flying way above the clouds?
